Data stored in Google Genomics is accessible via the `Google Genomics API`_.
This means that any programming language that can make network requests over
HTTPS can be used to access it.

We have `examples in github <https://github.com/googlegenomics/getting-started-with-the-api>`_, which can help get you started.
The code within each language-specific folder demonstrates the same things:

* Getting the read bases for NA12872 at a specific position
* Getting the variant overlapping that same position, and outputting the genotype

If this is what you are looking for, then take a look at the
|language-link| example.
