#. Create an ``input list file``
#. Create a ``job config file``
#. Create a gridengine cluster with sufficient disk space attached to each ``compute`` node
#. Upload input list file, config file, and ``grid-computing-tools`` source to the gridengine cluster master
#. Do a "dry run" (*optional*)
#. Do a "test run" (*optional*)
#. Launch the job

The following instructions provide guidance on each of these steps.
It is recommended, though not a requirement, that you save your
``input list file`` and ``job config file``
to a directory outside the ``grid-computing-tools`` directory.
For example, you might create a directory
``${WS_ROOT}/my_jobs``.
