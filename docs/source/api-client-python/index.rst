The Python client
-------------------

The `api-client-python <https://github.com/googlegenomics/api-client-python>`_ project
provides a simple genome browser that pulls data from the Genomics API.

The Python client does not currently use
`Google's Python client library <https://developers.google.com/api-client-library/python/>`_.
If you want to use the client library, the
`method documentation <https://developers.google.com/resources/api-libraries/documentation/genomics/v1/python/latest/>`_
for genomics can be very useful.
